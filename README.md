# Crime-detect  
### Crime and aggression detection  
  
## Introduction  
Crime-detect is a surveillance program designed to reduce the burden of threat detection on security personnel operating in the field of surveillance. We plan to use **TBA**. From there, we will raise a detection alert if there is a knife in the frame. Our plan is to implement two detectors for two of the most common weapons used in todayâ€™s crime scenes - pistols and knives.

## Problems Detected
- OpenPose creates problems when the knife detector is integrated, hard to distinguish between humans in the frame and who is holding the knife. Looking for other alternatives now.
