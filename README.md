# Crime-detect  
### Crime and aggression detection  
  
## Introduction  
Crime-detect is a surveillance program designed to reduce the burden of threat detection on security personnel operating in the field of surveillance. We plan to use OpenPose to do skeletal tracking of humans detected in the frame. From there, we will raise a detection alert  if there is a knife in the frame. Our plan is to implement two detectors for two of the most common weapons used in todayâ€™s crime scenes - pistols and knives.
